#Bias Variance Trade-Off is a Fundamental topic to understand model's performance

#--- THEORY -- 
#BVTradeOff is a the point where we are just adding noise by adding model complexity (flexibility)
#The training error goes down as it has to, but the test error will start  to go up
#The mode after the bias trade-off begins to overfit

#Dart board hits example 
    #low bias-low variance -> closer the centre - concentrated data points
    #low bias - high variance -> closer the centre - scattered aroudn data points
    #high bias - low variance -> not too close to centre - concentrated data points
    #high bias - high variance -> not too close to centre - more scattered all-over data points
